Ninja-Runner
============

A game with a running ninja.

The application folder contains a .exe that should hopefully run on most
windows machines. I haven't actually tested it.

The source was written with what ever version of Python 2 was newest in
early 2010. It also requires which ever Pygame version is compatible
with that version of Python. I looked it up and I'm going to guess that
it's Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.6/) and the
Pygame version that works with it (http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
