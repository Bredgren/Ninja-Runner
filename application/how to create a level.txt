How to make your own level:
1) Open '10x10lvlTemplate.png' from the 'data' file in 
   Paint.NET or something similar.
2) Create your level and save it in the 'data' folder.
   Most of the walls have been colored already to help save
   time. Don't worry about the red frame or the numbers.
   Each screen is a 30 pixel X 30 pixel square.
   The player will spawn on pixel (5, 28) relative to the
   30x30 start square.
   Each pixel represents a potential object. The color of the
   pixel determines which object will be displayed there according
   to the following:

ITEM NAME:     (RED,GREEN,BLUE)

nonthing:      (255,255,255)
border:        (255,0,0),
shiny floor:   (0,0,0),
grey floor:    (100,100,100),
shiny wallL:   (120,0,0),
shiny wallR:   (0,120,0),
shiny cornerBL:(0,0,120),
shiny cornerBR:(0,0,255),
shiny cornerTL:(120,120,0),
shiny cornerTR:(120,200,0),
door:          (120,120,255),
door top:      (120,255,120),
light:         (255,255,120),
white cealing: (200,200,200),
jet pack:      (255,120,0),
teleport:      (120,255,255),
health:        (0,255,0),
battery:       (255,255,0),
ball enemy:    (120,0,120),
robot enemy:   (120,0,255),
broken floor:  (255,0,120),
broken solid:  (255,120,120),
floor spike:   (255,0,255),
checkpoint:    (255,120,255)

3) Be sure to have it saved in the 'data' folder as a .png.

To make your level appear in the menu:
1) Open 'level data.txt'.
2) Create a new line at the bottom (make sure they are always after the epic level)
3) Write the level exactly as you saved it WITHOUT '.png', 
   followed by a colon (:).
4) The next space is where the record is held. Just put 3600.00
   or some other large number so that when it is played it will
   be overwriten on the first attempt. Followed by a colon.
5) Then put the x value of the square you inteded to be the 
   starting square. This will be a value from 1-10 as show
   across the top when seen in  the picture editor. Followed by a colon.
6) Then the y value, followed by a colon.
7) The last slot is the ninja time. You can put there what you want.
8) There should be no spaces unless your level name has spaces.
   Also none of the spots should be left blank or hold any 
   different kind of data then intended, it will cause the 
   game to crash when trying to read or write to the level data
   file.
9) Save the level data text file and the next time you play
   your level should appear at the end of the list.
